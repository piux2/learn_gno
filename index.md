# Overview


### Gnolang - Turn Knowledge into Action

Gno is part of the word gno.sis. Gno means knowlege and sis means action in greek. 

Gnolang is a language solution that helps turn your knowlege into action. 

It is a secure and easy to learn smart contract language.

It inherits the "simple", "explicit", "orthogonal", "concurrent" properties from golang, and enables "secure" features suited for smart contract programming. 

### Gnoland - Apply your knowledge 

A blockchain that supports Gnolang natively. It is powred by tendermint classic, cosmos sdk and ibc. 

### Golang VM - A Go interpreter implemented using Cosmos SDK.

It provides additional transparency and trust to inject a business logic layer as a smart contract into the chain. Source code and library are stored and verifiable on the chain. No need for a third trusted party to verify the source code matching the byte code.
